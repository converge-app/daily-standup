  - Question: How do you feel today?
  - Answer: I feel great
  - Question: What did you do since yesterday?
  - Answer: I added Redux for our test app, and failed to use AutoDevOps with GitLab. However, as our react app will need SSR anyway, it doesn't really matter too much. I also considered Next as our SSR, which will require some reconfiguration of the test app. I also read up on which communication platform to use, I decided to test with fetch, as it is the standard. For the sideeffects (fetch) we'll need either redux-saga or trunk. I also read up on Go for Webservices

  - Answer: Today I will setup the dockerfile for the nextjs test app. Hopefully with deployment

  - Answer: I feel great
  - Question: What did you do since Sep 20?
  - Answer: It has been a while :slightly_smiling_face:
First of all, I've nearly finished the restructuring of the frontend, the result seems pretty great. It has now integrated more deeply with material ui, formik and redux, which provides great functionality. The site has also launched on Zeit to use their lambda functions to drive agile development and scaleable infra. This is much easier than us having to host it ourselves. It also benefits in the case that it actually handles CI/CD for use in that case, with an included staging and prod environment.
Secondly, I've worked on a bit of the documentation, but also on the backend services, authentication and users services has been split, and a few services are planned for this sprint, such as project, bidding and broker etc.
  - Question: What will you do today?
  - Answer: Today I will probably write a bit more on the frontend, then open a PR, if I've got the time, I might read the documents Samir should have uploadet to GitBooks and if then I still have time write on some more services, and maybe make them a bit easier to replicate.

  - Question: What did you do since Sep 30?
  - Answer: Since monday I've done quite a bit, I've finished recoding the frontend app. I've implemented a new flow with redux and axios. Then I've done quite a bit of work on projects, I've made it possible to add and bid on projects through the web api. The thing that is still needed is the frontend and the ability for the backend to show a list of open projects (projects without a freelancer). Then I've done some work on the profile service, getting it ready for frontend work as well.
  - Question: What will you do today?
  - Answer: Today I don't have much time, but I'll probably do a bit of error checking and frontend work. I might also quickly do the profile backend or at least begin on it. This should be a blocker for Samir, so it could be nice if he had it, so that he could work tuesday and wednesday.
