It has now integrated more deeply with material ui, formik and redux, which provides great functionality. The site has also launched on Zeit to use their lambda functions to drive agile development and scaleable infra. This is much easier than us having to host it ourselves. It also benefits in the case that it actually handles CI\/CD for use in that case, with an included staging and prod environment.\nSecondly, I've worked on a bit of the documentation, but also on the backend services, authentication and users services has been split, and a few services are planned for this sprint, such as project, bidding and broker etc.",
