Then I've done quite a bit of work on projects, I've made it possible to add and bid on projects through the web api. The thing that is still needed is the frontend and the ability for the backend to show a list of open projects (projects without a freelancer). Then I've done some work on the profile service, getting it ready for frontend work as well.",
